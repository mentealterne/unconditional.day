          A place free of any outside influence for an unconditional and
          spontaneous information research.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Unconditional aims to provide a platform for independent and
          unfiltered information research, free from external influences. It was
          primarily motivated by a personal desire to empower ourselves through
          critical thinking, rather than relying on others for information.
        </p>
        <h1>You are the only one who can decide what to think.</h1>
        <p>
          This project does not employ any targeting, recommendation or ranking
          system, nor does it utilize profiling techniques. It is a simple
          search engine that indexes and serves information from a variety of
          sources that are not filtered or ranked in any way. The sources list
          is a public static file that anyone can contribute to. In few words:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There is no tracking,profiling,ranking,targeting and reccomendation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The community itself contributes to populate the list of sources to
            be served, resulting in a cluster of information that is: Apolitical
            and Unbiased.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>It is much simpler than you think, help us.</h1>

          sources of information it refers to. The server is re-deployed hourly
          by indexing and serving the new articles served by the sources it

          The project's main objective is to offer unbiased and free
